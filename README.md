# Malaria-Case-Control-Study-Analysis

Abstract

Background

Nigeria accounts for most of the malaria cases in Africa thus Malaria remains a public health challenge. To understand the barriers and facilitators of malaria transmission, this study aimed to determine the predictors of malaria infections in military communities in Nigeria.  

Methods

An unmatched case-control study was conducted in military communities in Nigeria. A total of 147 participants were enrolled. Hospital data were utilized to identify cases and controls that met the inclusion criteria as well as the sociodemographic characteristics of the study population while Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to derive crude odds ratios (OR) and adjusted ORs (aOR) respectively.


Results

The multivariable logistic analysis showed that sourcing non-piped water (aOR=5.57; 95% CI: 2.09-17.31), the use of Insecticide Treated Nets (aOR = 0.1; 95% CI: 0.02-0.35) and living in households with wooden walls or partitions (aOR = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.03-0.39) were associated with malaria. Also, families with sizes of 5 or more persons (aOR = 4.33; 95% CI: 1.19-20.4) were associated with malaria infections while educational level and insecticide use were not statistically significant.

Conclusion

This study calls for more understanding of malaria transmission among high-risk groups in the development of antimalarial interventions.
